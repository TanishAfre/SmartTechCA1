# SmartTechCA1

This project presents a comprehensive exploration of image classification utilizing the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. This assignment was part of the Smart Technology module where we were asked to develop a model capable of classifying images into 24 distinct categories containing different animals to vehicles. The model collects data from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively and presents an effective training model. During our research, we looked closely at the size and types of images in CIFAR datasets to understand it better. The main part of our project was building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was carefully examined and addressed underfitting and overfitting problems, ensuring a reliable code. The model results effectiveness in accurately classifying a diverse range of images, showcasing the potential of CNNs in complex image recognition tasks.
